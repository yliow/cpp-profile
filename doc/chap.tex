\section{Profilers}

\textsl{In software engineering, profiling (\lq\lq program profiling",
  \lq\lq software profiling") is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls. Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization, and more specifically, performance engineering.
